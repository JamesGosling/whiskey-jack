The name of this project is not completely random ;-)

Whiskey Jack is the common name in the Canadian Rockies for the [Canada jay (Perisoreus canadensis)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_jay).
These birds are troublemakers.
They often have very little fear of humans.
They enjoy [stealing food from hikers and their campsites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_jay#Cultural_significance).
They can be annoying (if it's your sandwich they stole),
or hilarious (if it's your brother's sandwich they stole).

This common name is an English approximation to the First Nations name,
that in turn is based on the name of the benevolent
[trickster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trickster)
[Wisakedjak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisakedjak)
of traditional storytelling.
Somewhat like Crow, Coyote or even Loki from other cultures.

They almost became the
[national bird of Canada](https://canadiangeographic.ca/articles/meet-our-national-bird-the-gray-jay/)
but the federal government declined to recognize the choice of ornithologists and citizens.

I chose the name because there is a fairly high density of tricky pieces of code in this project.

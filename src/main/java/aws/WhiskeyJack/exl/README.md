Meant to be used for code fragments in the diagram editor.
Should be able to translate code in a number of different languages
(Java, Rust, Python, JavaScript, ...)  If you want a full-blown
programming language, use one.  This is meant for simple computations
and API glue.

Intended for use in situations where expressions need to be
manipulated via, for example, symbolic algebra.

# CloudFormation
Build a CloudFormation file to launch a cloud app.
Some nodes will turn into resources to launch,
some will turn into code that interconnects and computes.

This is only a sketch: I don't know enough about CloudFormation and the details of template 
structure to be able to generate templates that actually work.

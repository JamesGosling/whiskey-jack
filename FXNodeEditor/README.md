This is a [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io) component that implements a node editor, in the spirit of the one found in [Blender](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.79/render/blender_render/materials/nodes/introduction.html).
It can be employed to edit all manner of node diagrams.

At least, eventually: right now it's a work in progress.
